# DSH MCP Connector Distribution Ledger

Last updated: 2026-09-22 (Asia/Shanghai)

This document is the source of truth for external distribution of
[`duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector`](https://github.com/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector).
It records whether a directory can discover, display, install, and verify the
plugin. It also prevents duplicate submissions to downstream mirrors that share
the same upstream data source.

## Canonical plugin identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | MCP Connector / MCP连接器 |
| Repository | [`duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector`](https://github.com/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector) |
| npm package | [`dsh-mcp-connector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-mcp-connector) |
| Current release | `0.2.57` (npm `latest`, checked 2026-09-22) |
| License | MIT |
| GitHub discovery topic | `dsh-plugin` |
| Plugin type | DSH client plugin, MCP connection manager, and connector marketplace |
| Canonical install | `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mcp-connector` |
| GitHub install fallback | `dsh plugin --profile web add github:duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector` |
| Bundle manifest | `package.json` `dsh.bundle.patch` -> `./cordis.patch.yml` |
| Primary category | Integration / Connectors / Plugin Markets & Managers |

The connector is not an MCP Server. Do not publish it to server-only registries
as a server. A directory is eligible only if it supports DSH plugins, clients,
connectors, aggregators, or marketplaces.

## Status model

The four acceptance dimensions are independent:

- **Discoverable**: an exact-name or relevant keyword search returns the plugin.
- **Metadata current**: the displayed description, version, commit, and install
  command match the current release.
- **Installable**: the directory exposes a correct command or has a successful
  install check.
- **Reviewed/verified**: a human review, manifest verification, or runtime test
  is recorded. Topic ingestion alone is not a security review.

`Listed` therefore does not automatically mean `Reviewed` or `Runtime tested`.

## Priority recheck: 2026-09-22

This is a point-in-time public-source check, not a fresh runtime test of every
market. npm published `0.2.57` at 09:36 UTC on 2026-09-22, less than an hour
before this check. A recently cached `0.2.54` entry may simply be awaiting its
normal sync; an incorrect npm-availability claim is a separate metadata defect.
The four columns below are independent. `Historical` means the earlier
acceptance was not rerun on 2026-09-22.

| Market | Discoverable | Metadata current for npm `0.2.57` | Installable | Reviewed / verified | 2026-09-22 evidence and next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/p/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector/) | Yes; [live feed](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/plugins.json) has one exact entry | No; feed shows `0.2.54` shortly after release | Correct canonical npm command; no new install test | Curated listing, not a runtime/security audit | [Statistics PR #5309](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/awesome-dsh-plugin/pull/5309) merged. Live feed reports `14,428` downloads for the explicit `2026-08-23`–`2026-09-21` window, checked `2026-09-22`; the [npm API](https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/2026-08-23:2026-09-21/dsh-mcp-connector) matches. Treat as downloads, not unique users. Wait for routine version sync; no duplicate PR. |
| [dshmarket.com](https://dshmarket.com/browse/) / `dsh-market` | Historical actual-UI search acceptance | Source consumes the awesome feed, but current production UI metadata was not rechecked | Historical canonical install acceptance | No new review | The [registry loader](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market/blob/main/src/registry.ts) and [client model](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market/blob/main/src/client/market-data.ts) currently retain only `downloads`, not the feed's download-window fields. Coordinate a source/UI tooltip change with the separate Market owner; do not claim the UI already labels the window. |
| [dshfind](https://dshfind.com/plugins/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector) | Yes | No; live check reports `0.2.51`, last synced 2026-09-22 07:57 UTC | npm package recognized; no new install test | Not confirmed | Track the existing [connector Issue #69](https://github.com/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector/issues/69); no new listing. |
| [DSH Plugin Directory](https://dsh.directory/plugins/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector) | Yes; accepted [submission #226](https://github.com/alexchenzl/dsh-plugin-directory/issues/226) | No; live check reports `0.2.54` | npm package recognized; no new install test | Submission accepted; no new runtime check | Wait for its normal refresh and track Issue #69. |
| [dsh.pub](https://dsh.pub/en/plugins/dsh-mcp-connector/) | Yes; duplicate PR #74 was closed as already listed | No; page shows `0.2.54` and still omits the npm link / reports npm unpublished | Commit-pinned command is shown; npm-package route is not represented correctly | Auto-analysis only | Added a factual update to the original [Issue #88](https://github.com/dsh-pub/dsh-pub/issues/88#issuecomment-5774911110). Correct the existing record; do not resubmit the package. |
| [dshbase](https://www.dshbase.com/plugins/dsh-mcp-connector/) | Yes | No; page remains at `0.2.37` and falsely says npm unpublished | Historical DSH install-test evidence; no fresh run | Verified badge retained | Added a factual update to the original [Issue #100](https://github.com/ylwl1997/dshbase/issues/100#issuecomment-5774912337); preserve accepted [runtime evidence #96](https://github.com/ylwl1997/dshbase/issues/96). |
| [dshmarketplace.dev](https://dshmarketplace.dev/api/v1/plugins?q=dsh-mcp-connector&limit=20) | Yes; one exact API result | Partial; no version field, description retained, star count lags the repository | `inRegistry=true`, `installable=true`, canonical npm command, historical `installCheck=passed` (2026-08-23) | Registry entry and install check, not a fresh runtime test | Already promoted to the independent Registry; no duplicate PR. Recheck mutable metadata after scheduled reconciliation. |
| [dsh-plugin.org](https://dsh-plugin.org/zh/plugins/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector) | Yes; dedicated page is public | No; structured data shows `v0.2.49` | npm link present; no new install test | Target page displays a verified badge; scope of review is not established | Existing listing needs a metadata refresh, not a new submission. Do not confuse the site's aggregate `unconfirmed` count with this plugin's badge. |
| [dsh-suite](https://github.com/dsh-suite/dsh-suite/issues/45) | Yes; formal `plugins` entry accepted | Package and canonical install mapping present; current release version is not exposed in the checked entry | Canonical npm command; no new install test | `compat.status=ok`, last verified 2026-09-18 on DSH `0.1.5-rc.2` | [Issue #45](https://github.com/dsh-suite/dsh-suite/issues/45) closed after [catalog commit `3145eea`](https://github.com/dsh-suite/dsh-suite/commit/3145eea6b6fb47dc6f6057cbea00ab9ffc0db388). A legacy watchlist record remains, but the formal listing supersedes it; do not submit again. |
| [dshmk](https://github.com/ZASENJC/dsh-plugins-store/issues/7) | Historical topic/index presence; direct detail URL returned 404 during this check | Current page metadata not verified | Historical independent DSH install passed at `0.2.30`; validator-only dependency failure remains unresolved | Issue #7 open; no maintainer disposition | Ask for sanitized validator command/stderr or a manual-review outcome. Do not equate the stale indexed topic page with a current successful validation. |
| [DSH Extension Hub](https://github.com/Relistencode/dsh-extension-hub/issues/12) | Historical actual-UI `Discover More` acceptance; not rerun today | Current search card not rechecked | Historical isolated install passed | Curated-view review still open | npm `dsh-extension-hub@0.2.19` and source still have a 15-second catalog timeout with HTTP-200 fallback; [Issue #12](https://github.com/Relistencode/dsh-extension-hub/issues/12) awaits maintainer action. Do not claim a newly reproduced UI failure. |

The automated `distribution:check:live` result on this date was
`ok=false, converged=false`, with the listed dshfind, Directory, dsh.pub, and
dshbase drift. The check does not imply the freshly published `0.2.57` should
already have reached every scheduled cache. [Issue #69](https://github.com/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector/issues/69)
remains the deduplicated coordination point; its last automated update at
09:34 UTC preceded the `0.2.57` npm publication.

## Historical distribution coverage matrix

The following rows retain their own last-verified dates. They are historical
coverage evidence, not blanket claims that all listed markets were re-audited
on 2026-09-22. Use the priority recheck above for the latest status of its
named markets.

External maintainers control review and merge times. `Submitted` is not the same
as `Accepted`, and neither is the same as `Visible in production`.

## P1 runtime acceptance evidence

The following acceptance was performed in a real local Harness runtime on
2026-08-30 and 2026-08-31. No third-party account or credential was connected
during the tests.

| Check | Environment / action | Result |
|---|---|---|
| MCP Connector install and activation | macOS 26.5.1 arm64; Node.js `v25.9.0`; DSH `0.1.1-rc.2`; `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mcp-connector@0.2.30` | Passed. The profile listed `dsh-mcp-connector@0.2.30`, DSH Web started, the sidebar displayed `MCP连接器`, and the dialog displayed `当前版本 v0.2.30` with marketplace and installed-card views rendered |
| Extension Hub isolated install | Fresh temporary `DSH_HOME`; `dsh-extension-hub@0.2.19`; DSH `0.1.1-rc.2` | Passed. Extension Management and Plugin Market UI mounted without modifying the normal DSH profile |
| Extension Hub `Discover More` search | Query `dsh-mcp-connector` in the actual Plugin Market UI | Passed. Exact repository result, current description, and 8-star metadata were returned |
| Extension Hub `Curated` search | Default Registry-backed view against `https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/plugins.json` | Blocked upstream. The response is HTTP 200 with `content-length: 2343281`, but body download exceeded the plugin's 15-second timeout before JSON parsing; tracked in Issue #12 |
| DSH Market search relevance | Actual `dshmarket@1.38.1` Discover UI; all categories; approximately 2.5k entries; queries `mcp`, `mcp连接器`, `连接器`, `mcp server`, and `连接管理` | Passed. The connector ranked first for four queries and fifth for `mcp server`; the latter is recorded as a non-blocking metadata/ranking observation rather than an index or deployment failure |
| DSH Market current search revalidation | Actual `dshmarket@1.46.1` Discover UI; all categories; approximately 3.6k entries; same five queries | Core search remains strong: first for `mcp`, `mcp连接器`, `连接器`, and `连接管理`. `mcp server` is fifteenth, a measurable relevance regression to investigate separately |

## Reusable submission packet

Use the following facts for manual forms, Issues, and PRs. Adapt the category to
the destination schema without changing the product identity.

- Repository: `https://github.com/duhu2000/dsh-mcp-connector`
- npm: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-mcp-connector`
- Release: `0.2.57`
- License: MIT
- Category preference: `Integrations & Connectors`; otherwise
  `Plugins & Runtime`, `Integration`, or `Plugin Markets & Managers`
- Install: `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-mcp-connector`
- Remove: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-mcp-connector`
- Supported target: DeepSeek Harness Desktop/web profile; Node.js 20+
- English description: `MCP Connector for DeepSeek Harness with a directory of over one hundred connectors. Connect to MCP servers, search tools across connections, manage and troubleshoot connections, filter by connection/server/status, inspect readable parameters and the last successful cache time, and use per-connection diagnostics and tool rediscovery; supports OAuth 2.0 PKCE, API keys, stdio/HTTP, and mcpServers JSON import. Maintained by Qichacha/QCC.`
- Chinese description: `MCP连接器：在 DeepSeek Harness 中通过持续更新的超百个 MCP连接器目录接入 MCP Server、跨连接查找工具，并完成连接管理与连接排障；可按连接/服务/发现状态筛选，查看易读参数、最后成功缓存时间和诊断，并逐连接重新发现工具；支持 OAuth 2.0 PKCE、API Key、stdio/HTTP 和 mcpServers JSON 导入；由企查查/QCC 团队维护。`

Never claim that directory ingestion is a code or security audit. Never claim
that the connector is an MCP Server.

## Acceptance and reporting cadence

After each external action, update the relevant row and report:

1. confirmed searchable markets;
2. metadata-current markets;
3. install-verified markets;
4. human-reviewed or runtime-verified markets;
5. submitted, merged, and production-visible external changes;
6. blockers, stale snapshots, and next actions;
7. evidence URLs and verification timestamp.

For topic or awesome consumers, wait for the documented synchronization SLA
before escalating. Do not open a duplicate PR merely because a downstream cache
has not refreshed yet.

Run `npm run distribution:check:live` for an immediate comparison of the
canonical npm release with the monitored public directories. The daily
`External directory sync` workflow keeps one deduplicated repository Issue open
while required metadata is stale or invalid, and closes it automatically after
the public pages converge. Temporary network outages are reported as
`unavailable` but do not create false drift failures.

## Out-of-scope directories

Do not submit the connector itself to the Official MCP Registry, Smithery,
Glama, or another server-only directory. Re-evaluate only if the destination
adds an explicit Clients, Connectors, Aggregators, or Marketplaces category.
A future remote meta-server would be a separate product and must have its own
identity, package, security review, and distribution entry.
